# SMS Spam Collection Dataset
The SMS Spam Collection is a public set of SMS labeled messages that have been collected for mobile phone spam research. This dataset consists of about 5572 rows with labels containing either Spam/ Ham. The goal of this project is to predict whether a sms belongs to Spam/ Ham class.

The project aims to demonstrate Natural language processing skills using Python for Machine Learning. It reads the text, cleans it, vectorizes it using different techniques, creates features, builds different models and evaluates those models using CrossFoldValidation, tunes hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and selects an optimal model depending on the results of different metrics.
